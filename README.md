# FoT-Gateway-Mapping-Devices

## Introduction

This module is responsible for mapping devices connected with each FoT-Gateway. It is used by other modules to get access of basic information about devices and yours sensors/actuators.

It is the basic module of SOFT-IoT, so its installation need be previous to other modules.

It was developed using Apache ServiceMix 6.1.1

## Installation

To install this bundle using our custom maven support execute the following commands in Karaf Shell:

```sh
config:edit org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn 
config:property-append org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.repositories ", https://github.com/WiserUFBA/wiser-mvn-repo/raw/master/releases@id=wiser"
config:update
bundle:install mvn:br.ufba.dcc.wiser.soft_iot/soft-iot-mapping-devices/1.0.0
```
Before install the module do you need copy the configuration file from src here in GitHub:
```
soft-iot-mapping-devices/src/main/resources/br.ufba.dcc.wiser.soft_iot.gateway.mapping_devices.cfg
```
to:
```
_servicemix_directory_/etc
```

In this file you need configure what is the devices that is connected in your IoT system and the time (frequency) you want to collect data.

Syntax of different type of devices (it is important use this to match with enrichment of semantic description):
